                                I am a Radiologist in a private practice for 20 years, who is about to finish a full-stack developer coding bootcamp. From this course I have aquired deep understanding and technical expertise in Javascript, ReactJS, Redux, NodeJS, MongoDb, CSS, HTML and many other technologies including working with GitHub! I have keen interest in working with databases. Especially in Healthcare, I would some day like to use these skills of working with databases to improve physician to patient communication. My particular emphasis will be to communicate and track actionable non-urgent Radiologic findings directly to patient, in addition to patient's primary care physician.
